// T-Deck launcher: GPS on/off control bridge (firmware side)
//
// Companion to TDeckGpsBridge.cpp (which only *reads* GPS status). This one lets
// the device-ui settings screen turn the GPS on or off and — when on — keep it
// searching continuously, applied LIVE with no reboot.
//
// Why a bridge + deferred service (same story as TDeckMeshSwitch.cpp): the LVGL
// UI runs on its own FreeRTOS task and must not drive the GPS driver directly (it
// sends UART commands and shares state with the GPS OSThread). So the UI-facing
// setter only records intent; tdeck_gps_control_service(), called from the main
// loop(), applies it on the same cooperative thread the GPS OSThread and
// AdminModule use — exactly where gps->enable()/disable() are already known-safe.
//
// "Continuous" = a gps_update_interval of 10s. At or below
// GPS_UPDATE_ALWAYS_ON_THRESHOLD_MS the GPS driver never powers the chip down
// between fixes (see GPS::down()), so it is always looking for satellites. The
// stock default is 120s, which is why the GPS otherwise sleeps in ~2-minute
// stretches and appears to "not look" until something happens to catch it awake.
// Longer intervals nap the chip between checks and save battery.

// including driving, without a lock - then flipping the Settings switch off and on gave
// satellites almost immediately. After the device slept it died again and only the toggle
// revived it. Both gaps are the same root cause: the ONLY thing that ever called
// gps->enable() with the continuous interval was that switch. At boot the stored (possibly
// long) interval left the chip napping between searches, and after a sleep nothing re-armed
// it at all. This does automatically what Jake was doing by hand.
