// T-Deck launcher: a wake-up alarm (firmware side).
//
// jejeronimo, t-ui#9 "Wake up app": "Yes, it is an alarm clock to wake me up in the morning."
// Jake's call on where it goes: "#9 we can add to the timer app and rename it clock."
//
// ⭐ WHY THIS IS FIRMWARE-SIDE AND NOT IN THE APP. The obvious place is StopwatchApp.cpp, next
// to the countdown timer it sits beside - and that would be wrong. An alarm that only runs
// while its own screen is open is not an alarm; the entire point is that it fires at 6am with
// the device face-down, locked and dark. So the clock lives here, is checked from loop(), and
// does not care what is on screen or whether anything is on screen at all. The app is only a
// way to set it.
//
// THREADING: the same deferred pattern as TDeckClockFormat.cpp and TDeckUnits.cpp. The UI runs
// on its own FreeRTOS task and writing settings to flash from there is what froze the device
// when the time-zone dropdown first tried it (see TDeckTimeZone.cpp). The UI-facing setter
// records intent; tdeck_alarm_service() does the write on the safe thread.
//
// TIME: localtime() is correct here because TDeckTimeZone.cpp calls tzset() at boot, and the
// epoch comes from getValidTime() - the same source the message log and the lock screen use.
// With no fix and no RTC there is no valid time, and an alarm that does not know what time it
// is must stay silent rather than guess.
